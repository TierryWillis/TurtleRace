<h1 align="center"> Turtle Race </h1>

## Description
This project is a turtle racing simulator developed in C#. In it, you can create up to five turtles to compete. Turtles' performance in the race is influenced by their physical characteristics, such as weight and height. Additionally, the project uses sounds to improve the user experience and makes use of threads to manage concurrency during the race simulation.

## Functionalities
- **Turtle Breeding:** Allows the creation of up to five turtles, each with specific weight and height attributes.
- **Racing Simulation:** Turtles compete against each other, based on defined attributes.
- **Impact of Attributes on Performance:** The weight and height of turtles directly influence their performance in the race.
- **Sound Effects:** Sounds are used to make the simulation more immersive.
- **Use of Threads:** The race is managed using threads to simulate competition between turtles.


## How to use
1 - **Turtle Breeding:**
- When starting the program, you will be asked to create up to five turtles.
- For each turtle, enter the weight and height attributes.

2 - **Start of the Race:**
- After creating the turtles, start the race.
- The race will be displayed on the screen, showing each turtle's progress.

3 - **Race Result:**
- At the end of the race, the winner will be announced based on performance calculated from physical attributes.
